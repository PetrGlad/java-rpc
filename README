Test task given to me by one of potential employers.

Task described multi-service client-cserver rpc with possible out-of order execution 
(server may return answers in different order than they were requested).
Server should accept clients in single thread and pccept commands in per-client threads and use pull of threads to process them (not yet implemented).
Java serialization should be used. Services are configured via config file. 
Log4j is used for logging.

Build:
	gradle build
