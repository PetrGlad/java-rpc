Test task given to me by one of potential employers.

Task described multi-service client-cserver rpc with possible out-of order execution 
(server may return answers in different order than they were requested).
Server should accept clients in single thread and pccept commands in per-client threads and use pull of threads to process them.
Java serialization should be used. Services are configured via config file. 
Log4j is used for logging.

Although these requirements look overdesigned I tried to follow them. 
Remaining serious TODO is to test with many parallel clients and requests. 
Client code also seems too clumsy (asynchronous calls would fit this architecture better).

Build:
	gradle build
Run:
	Server services.config port
	Client serverHost port
