Test task given to me by one of potential employers.

In brief, task described multi-service client-server RPC with possible out-of order execution 
(server may return answers in different order than they were requested).
Server should accept clients in single thread and accept commands in per-client threads 
and use pool of threads to process them.
Java serialization should be used. Services are configured via configuration file. 
Log4j is used for logging.

Although these requirements look overdesigned I tried to follow them. Also, suggested client-side 
interface was synchronous but in looks too clumsy in this task - asynchronous calls would fit this architecture better. 

Build:
	gradle build
Run:
	Server services.config port
	Client serverHost port
